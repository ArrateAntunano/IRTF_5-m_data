Antuñano et al. 2019 (https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/ab2cd6) used Jupiter infrared data captured by 7 different ground-based instruments 
mounted on the Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) between 1983-2018 to investigate Jupiter's long-term atmospheric variablity at 5 µm.

This repository contains Jupiter 5-µm observations capture by BOLO-1, ProtoCam, NSFCam, MIRSI, NSFCam2, SpeX and TEXES instruments mounted at 
the Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Maunakea, Hawai'i, between 1983 and 2019.

ProtoCam observations were reduced, mapped and mosaicked by J. Harrington (Harrington et al. 1996, 1996b).
BOLO-1 observations were reduced by Orton et al. (Orton et al. 1991, 1994). 
A. Antuñano reduced and mapped NSFCam, MIRSI, NSFCam2, SpeX and TEXES observations.

*Important: These data need to be scaled or calibrated to be able to compare it between different dates and instruments. See Antuñano et al (2018, 2019)
for more information on how to do this.
